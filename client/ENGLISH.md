The CCVP client is written in python and aims to exemplify the concepts used by the CCVP protocol.

## Installation

The installation of the py client is not necessary, but it does require Python on your machine.

Once you have python, `execute`:
```bash
python3 client.py
```

Note that the [CCVP Server](../server/README.md) must be active.
